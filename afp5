                <h2>Pagani Zonda R</h2>
                <p>The Pagani Zonda R is a track day car developed and manufactured by Italian sports car manufacturer Pagani. It debuted at the 2007 Geneva Motor Show, using the 6.0-litre GT 112 engine sourced from the racing version of the Mercedes-Benz CLK-GTR. The Zonda R's competition lies with track-based cars, such as the Ferrari FXX and Maserati MC12 Corse rather than the original Zonda's road competitors as it is not road-legal.</p>
